# Sam's Fishing Lifelist

I decided to start [lifelisting](https://blog.nature.org/science/2015/09/10/obsessed-nature-fishy-life-listing-fish-fishing-naturalist) since it's fun
and I mostly catch and release -- my photos were becoming quite disorganized and I was curious to find out how many different kinds of fish I've caught.
Unfortunately this led me to a few realizations:

1. I didn't take pictures of every species I've ever caught. I'm regretting it now, because I would feel bad if I included those fish. I'll have to get them again.
2. Some fish look different within the same species; e.g male vs female, barred vs unbarred, anadromous vs freshwater only.
3. I've hooked up with some fish but failed to land and get a picture of them.

At any rate I'll catch, photograph, and release the fish I missed / failed to get pictures of in due time.

_Note: This list contains (usually) the first fish of each species that I managed to photograph, chronologically. The fish pictured is not usually the largest of the species that I caught, nor is it the first of that species that I ever caught -- it's just (usually) the first to get on film. This list is also not that reflective of how much I fish, because I mostly do catch the same kinds of fish at my local spots. I don't go super out of my way to add species to this list. I haven't been bitten by the microfishing game just yet, for example :)_

## Unique Species List (Photographed)

61 unique species caught and fully identified as of November 19, 2024. 4 additional species
caught but not fully identified, and more caught but not recorded in pictures (thus omitted here).

<!--

I used this prompt with my old format to get the table:

Here's a list of fish I caught in markdown.

Generate a table where the notes are not summaries but full length notes that I took for each row. The table should have the following columns, in this order

* Index (auto incrementing #)
* Date caught (YYYY-MM-DD)
* Fish Species (with link to image preserved)
* Latin Name
* Method used to catch (leave blank if unspecified)
* Location (leave blank if unspecified)
* Tags (can be as many as fit from categories like "Inshore", "Flatfish", "Freshwater", "Gamefish", "Special/Rare", "Pelagic", etc) (leave blank if none fit)
* Notes (my notes on the fish, verbatim)

Return the full table. Do not truncate.

Order the results by date (oldest first)

I'll generate the table as you specified. Here's the markdown table with all the fish, ordered by date:

-->

## Variations

These are not unique species but are different versions of species on the unique list.

* [Rainbow Trout - Steelhead](img/doubles/2019-12-08_steelhead.jpg) - Caught at Stevens Creek Reservoir, Cupertino CA. Rare native (not stocked).
* [Barred Surfperch - unbarred Version](img/doubles/2020-05-22_barred_surfperch_unbarred_version.jpg) - Caught on the northern california coastline near Daly City.
* [Black Crappie - light colored version](img/doubles/2018-08-17_black_crappie.jpg) - Caught at Stevens Creek Reservoir, Cupertino CA. Despite being light in color, this is indeed a black crappie (7-8 dorsal spines vs 5-6 on a white crappie; not barred pattern).
* [Gray/Bermuda Chub - different color](img/doubles/2020_03_01_gray_or_bermuda_chub.jpg) - It's actually impossible to tell the difference between a Bermuda (_Kyphosus sectatrix_) or Gray chub (_Kyphosus Biggibus_) without counting gill rakers, so I will never know which one I caught -- I'm counting them as a single species since they're a complex now. The one on my lifelist is more mature.

## Not on the list because no picture but fish I've definitely caught

* Vermillion Rockfish
* Blue Rockfish
* Black Rockfish
* Pumpkinseed Sunfish
* Redbreast Sunfish

* Channel Catfish (high school, Holmdel Park Pond)

## Fish I hooked up with but did not land

* Cutthroat trout - Jumped out of the water when it hit my hopper near mammoth lakes.

## Species Specific Size Records

## How I identify fish

I haven't caught that many rare fish, so mostly they are easy to recognize. But a few times now I've had to 
defer to experts or scour through indices. Here are some of the tools I use:

* [Fishbase](https://www.fishbase.us)
* [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)
* CA DFW
  * [Surfperch Identification](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36617)
