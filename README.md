# Sam's Fishing Lifelist

I decided to start [lifelisting](https://blog.nature.org/science/2015/09/10/obsessed-nature-fishy-life-listing-fish-fishing-naturalist) since it's fun
and I mostly catch and release -- my photos were becoming quite disorganized and I was curious to find out how many different kinds of fish I've caught.
Unfortunately this led me to a few realizations:

1. I didn't take pictures of every species I've ever caught. I'm regretting it now, because I would feel bad if I included those fish. I'll have to get them again.
2. Some fish look different within the same species; e.g male vs female, barred vs unbarred, anadromous vs freshwater only.
3. I've hooked up with some fish but failed to land and get a picture of them.

At any rate I'll catch, photograph, and release the fish I missed / failed to get pictures of in due time.

_Note: This list contains (usually) the first fish of each species that I managed to photograph, chronologically. The fish pictured is not usually the largest of the species that I caught, nor is it the first of that species that I ever caught -- it's just (usually) the first to get on film. This list is also not that reflective of how much I fish, because I mostly do catch the same kinds of fish at my local spots. I don't particularly go out of my way to add species to this list._

## Unique Species List (Photographed)

35 unique species caught and identified as of August 8, 2020. 3 additional fishes
caught but not identified (see "to identify" folder). I should be at 38 total unique fish types once those are identified.

## Variations

These are not unique species but are different versions of species on the unique list.

* [Rainbow Trout - Steelhead](img/doubles/2019-12-08_steelhead.jpg) - Caught at Stevens Creek Reservoir, Cupertino CA. Rare native (not stocked).
* [Barred Surfperch - Unbarred Version](img/doubles/2020-05-22_barred_surfperch_unbarred_version.jpg) - Caught on the northern california coastline near Daly City.
* [Black Crappie - light colored version](img/doubles/2018-08-17_black_crappie.jpg) - Caught at Stevens Creek Reservoir, Cupertino CA. Despite being light in color, this is indeed a black crappie (7-8 dorsal spines vs 5-6 on a white crappie; not barred pattern).
* [Gray/Bermuda Chub](img/doubles/2020_03_01_gray_or_bermuda_chub.jpg) - It's actually impossible to tell the difference between a Bermuda (_Kyphosus sectatrix_) or Gray chub (_Kyphosus Biggibus_) without counting gill rakers, so I will never know which one I caught -- I'm counting them as a single species since they're a complex now. This young one is more gray and the one on my lifelist is more colorful / more mature.

## Not on the list because no picture but fish I've definitely caught

## How I identify fish

I haven't caught that many rare fish, so mostly they are easy to recognize. But a few times now I've had to 
defer to experts or scour through indices. Here are some of the tool I use:

* [Fishbase](https://www.fishbase.us)
* [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)
* CA DFW
  * [Surfperch Identification](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36617)
