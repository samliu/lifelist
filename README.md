# Sam's Fishing Lifelist

I decided to start [lifelisting](https://blog.nature.org/science/2015/09/10/obsessed-nature-fishy-life-listing-fish-fishing-naturalist) since it's fun
and I mostly catch and release -- my photos were becoming quite disorganized and I was curious to find out how many different kinds of fish I've caught.
Unfortunately this led me to a few realizations:

1. I didn't take pictures of every species I've ever caught. I'm regretting it now, because I would feel bad if I included those fish. I'll have to get them again.
2. Some fish look different within the same species; e.g male vs female, barred vs unbarred, anadromous vs freshwater only.
3. I've hooked up with some fish but failed to land and get a picture of them.

At any rate I'll catch, photograph, and release the fish I missed / failed to get pictures of in due time.

_Note: This list contains (usually) the first fish of each species that I managed to photograph, chronologically. The fish pictured is not usually the largest of the species that I caught, nor is it the first of that species that I ever caught -- it's just (usually) the first to get on film. This list is also not that reflective of how much I fish, because I mostly do catch the same kinds of fish at my local spots. I don't go super out of my way to add species to this list. I haven't been bitten by the microfishing game just yet, for example :)_

## Unique Species List (Photographed)

61 unique species caught and fully identified as of November 19, 2024. 4 additional species
caught but not fully identified, and more caught but not recorded in pictures (thus omitted here).

I apologize for the oversight. You're correct that some of the notes were truncated or omitted in the table. I'll refactor the table to include all the notes you provided for each fish species. Here's the updated table with the full notes:

* [Gulf Flounder (_Paralichthys albigutta_)](img/2023-09-08_gulf_flounder.jpg) - Caught on an olive/white sand eel teaser tied above my goofy jig. Identify this using the dark spots near the tail - they form a triangle.

* [Gulf Kingfish (_Menticirrhus littoralis_)](img/2023-09-12_gulf_kingfish.jpg) - There were a lot of these and I caught them on goofy jigs, size 0.75L silver holo deadly dick, and sand flea fishbites on a size four hook.

* [Californian Anchovy (_Engraulis mordax_)](img/2023_04_11_anchovy.jpg) - Caught on a tiny sabiki rig off the pier. Pacifica, CA.


## Variations

These are not unique species but are different versions of species on the unique list.

* [Rainbow Trout - Steelhead](img/doubles/2019-12-08_steelhead.jpg) - Caught at Stevens Creek Reservoir, Cupertino CA. Rare native (not stocked).
* [Barred Surfperch - unbarred Version](img/doubles/2020-05-22_barred_surfperch_unbarred_version.jpg) - Caught on the northern california coastline near Daly City.
* [Black Crappie - light colored version](img/doubles/2018-08-17_black_crappie.jpg) - Caught at Stevens Creek Reservoir, Cupertino CA. Despite being light in color, this is indeed a black crappie (7-8 dorsal spines vs 5-6 on a white crappie; not barred pattern).
* [Gray/Bermuda Chub - different color](img/doubles/2020_03_01_gray_or_bermuda_chub.jpg) - It's actually impossible to tell the difference between a Bermuda (_Kyphosus sectatrix_) or Gray chub (_Kyphosus Biggibus_) without counting gill rakers, so I will never know which one I caught -- I'm counting them as a single species since they're a complex now. The one on my lifelist is more mature.

## Not on the list because no picture but fish I've definitely caught

* Vermillion Rockfish
* Blue Rockfish
* Black Rockfish
* Pumpkinseed Sunfish
* Redbreast Sunfish
* Atlantic Stingray (when I was young)

## How I identify fish

I haven't caught that many rare fish, so mostly they are easy to recognize. But a few times now I've had to 
defer to experts or scour through indices. Here are some of the tools I use:

* [Fishbase](https://www.fishbase.us)
* [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)
* CA DFW
  * [Surfperch Identification](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36617)
