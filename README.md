# Sam's Fishing Lifelist

This will record all the kinds of fish I have caught. I'm counting steelhead
and rainbows as different fish despite same species.

## List

36 unique fish types (35 species) caught and identified as of August 8, 2020. 6
additional fishes caught but not identified (see "to identify" folder) -- most
are unique but some may be duplicates. I suspect I'm at 42 total unique fish
types once those are identified.

## How I identify fish

I haven't caught that many rare fish, so mostly they are easy to recognize.
But for exotic species or specific subspecies, [Fishbase](https://www.fishbase.de)
is fairly helpful!
