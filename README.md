# Sam's Fishing Lifelist

I decided to start [lifelisting](https://blog.nature.org/science/2015/09/10/obsessed-nature-fishy-life-listing-fish-fishing-naturalist) since it's fun
and I mostly catch and release -- my photos were becoming quite disorganized and I was curious to find out how many different kinds of fish I've caught.
Unfortunately this led me to a few realizations:

1. I didn't take pictures of every species I've ever caught. I'm regretting it now, because I would feel bad if I included those fish. I'll have to get them again.
2. Some fish look different within the same species; e.g male vs female, barred vs unbarred, anadromous vs freshwater only.
3. I've hooked up with some fish but failed to land and get a picture of them.

At any rate I'll catch, photograph, and release the fish I missed / failed to get pictures of in due time.

_Note: This list contains mostly the first fish of each species that I managed to photograph, chronologically. The fish pictured is not usually
the largest of the species that I caught, nor is it even the first of that species that I caught -- it's just the first to get on film. This list
is also not that reflective of how much I fish, because I mostly do catch the same kinds of fish at my local spots. I don't particularly go out of
my way to add species to this list._

## Unique Species List (Photographed)

## How I identify fish

I haven't caught that many rare fish, so mostly they are easy to recognize. But a few times now I've had to 
defer to experts or scour through indices. Here are some of the tool I use:

* [Fishbase](https://www.fishbase.us)
* [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org)
* CA DFW
  * [Surfperch Identification](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36617)
